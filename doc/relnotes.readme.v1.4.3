IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

I) Checking out the code from VLab

Make the home directory for the model in $NWROOT:
> mkdir nwps
> cd nwps

Clone the NWPS code from the following Github repo, and checkout the release tag:
> git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/nwps.git
> git checkout IT-nwps.v1.4.3-20220801

II) Building the executables

First define the path variable ${NWPSdir} in your profile file, which points to the base of the code checked out under (I) above.
> export NWPSdir=$(pwd)

Next, change directory to ${NWPSdir}/sorc/, and execute the general NWPS install script. This single step will install the total 
package, including all libraries and binary compilations:

> cd ${NWPSdir}/sorc
> ./make_NWPS.sh

Once the compilations are done, all executables are moved to ${NWPSdir}/exec, and the system will be ready.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Test the NWPS on-demand runs

Conduct on-demand runs for the six WFOS domains listed above, namely MFL, KEY,
LIX, AKQ, LOX, AFG. Compare the results of this test to the COMOUT listed 
above: /lfs/h2/emc/ptmp/andre.vanderwesthuysen/com/nwps/v1.4.3/

The files shiproute_plots_CG1_${PDY}${CYC}.tar.gz should be present. After 
unzipping this tarball, the graphics files it contains should display the
correct date of each forecast hour (compare hour 0 with the analysis time 
listed in the Warn_Forecaster*.txt file).
