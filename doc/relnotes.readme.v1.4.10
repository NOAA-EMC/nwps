TITLE:
Nearshore Wave Prediction System (NWPS) v1.4.10

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS:
Routine change: cosmetic upgrade, bug fix, patch

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE:
Bugfix for a run failure for wave system tracking for nclust=2. In rare occasions, the silhouette_coeff_k2.txt file will not be created and consequently the ww3_systrk_cluster_parallel.py python script fails to run.Â’

When WFOs submit runs at 23Z, it causes a failure in the post_cg1 job due to an incorrect calculation of the time_step parameter for runup and rip current grib2 encoding. This incorrect calculation leads to the failure of Python scripts responsible for plotting runup, overwash, and rip current data.

The $NWPSdir/dev/ecf and /job scripts are changed to be able to run retro runs on WCOSS2 machine.

JOB DEPENDENCIES:
(Same as NWPSv1.4.9)
This system has upstream dependencies on the following WCOSS models:
 - GFS (wave boundary conditions)
 - RTOFS Global (surface current fields)
 - Global STOFS (water level fields)
 - MMAB Sea Ice Analysis (sea ice fields)
 - P-Surge (water level fields)
 - GFS pgrb files (U10 fields for GFS fail-over option)

The system has upstream data dependencies on:
 - User input received from AWIPS via LDM

This system currently has no downstream dependencies.

REQUIRED SYSTEM USAGE:
Same as NWPSv1.4.9

BENEFITS OF CHANGE:
Greater system stability.

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:
Same as NWPSv1.4.9

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:
Same as NWPSv1.4.9

RISKS:
Same as NWPSv1.4.9

PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION
At the first available opportunity.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

I) Checking out the code from Github

Make the home directory for the model in $NWROOT:
> mkdir nwps
> cd nwps

Clone the NWPS code from the following Github repo, and check out the release tag:
> git clone https://github.com/AliS-Noaa/nwps.git
> git checkout nwps_sys_trk

II) Building the executables

First define the path variable ${NWPSdir} in your profile file, which points to the base of the code checked out under (I) above.
> export NWPSdir=$(pwd)

Next, change directory to ${NWPSdir}/sorc/, and execute the general NWPS install script. This single step will install the total
package, including all libraries and binary compilations:

> cd ${NWPSdir}/sorc
> ./make_NWPS.sh

Once the compilations are done, all executables are moved to ${NWPSdir}/exec, and the system will be ready.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS
For wave system tracking:
Conduct retro runs using for the reported failed jobs for the CRP and PHI domains:
The failed jobs path: /lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/ali.salimi/work/pnwps_crp_prod_20230702_1057Z
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/ali.salimi/work/pnwps_phi_prod.failed_wavetrack_cg1.20230526

The fixed job path:

/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/ali.salimi/work/runs/phi.20230526

For wave post_cg1 failure:
Conduct retro run using the reported failed job for JAX domain:
The failed jobs path: 
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/ali.salimi/work/runs/jax.20230711-failed

wgrib2 /lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/ali.salimi/work/runs/jax.20230711-failed/output/grib2/CG1/jax_nwps_CG1_20230710_2300.grib2
Will show a negative hour fcst for runup and rip current.

The fixed job path:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/ali.salimi/work/runs/jax.20230711-fixed
