testing was done in standalone mode by Ali Salimi

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

I) Checking out the code from github

Make the home directory for the model in $NWROOT:
> mkdir nwps
> cd nwps

Clone the NWPS code from the following Github repo, and checkout the release tag:
> git clone --branch main https://github.com/sbanihash/nwps.git

II) Building the executables

First define the path variable ${NWPSdir} in your profile file, which points to the base of the code checked out under (I) above.
> export NWPSdir=$(pwd)

Next, change directory to ${NWPSdir}/sorc/, and execute the general NWPS install script. This single step will install the total 
package, including all libraries and binary compilations:

> cd ${NWPSdir}/sorc
> ./make_NWPS.sh

Once the compilations are done, all executables are moved to ${NWPSdir}/exec, and the system will be ready.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Test the with Failure runs:

NCO SPA (Arash Bigdeli) has the setup to reproduce the error with ecflow. He can rerun the failures for AGF.20240603 and HFO.20240525

Checking real time runs to see if the plots are producing as expected could be done with checking ${WORKdir}/var/${WFO}.tmp/CG1/*png
