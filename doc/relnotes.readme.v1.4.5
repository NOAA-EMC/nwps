TITLE: 
Nearshore Wave Prediction System (NWPS) v1.4.5

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS: 
Accelerated change: rapid response required for change or corrective action

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE:  
Bugfix for a run failure when WFOs submit runs outside of the 3-hourly cadence of 00z, 03z, 06z, 09z, etc. This specifically 
impacts the WFO domains where ship route plots are produced, namely AKQ, MFL, KEY, LIX, LOX, AJK, AER, ALU, and AFG.

JOB DEPENDENCIES:
(Same as NWPSv1.4.4)
This system has upstream dependencies on the following WCOSS models:
 - GFS (wave boundary conditions)
 - RTOFS Global (surface current fields)
 - Global ESTOFS (water level fields)
 - MMAB Sea Ice Analysis (sea ice fields) 
 - P-Surge (water level fields)
 - GFS pgrb files (U10 fields for GFS fail-over option) 

The system has upstream data dependencies on:
 - User input received from AWIPS via LDM

This system currently has no downstream dependencies.

REQUIRED SYSTEM USAGE:
Same as NWPSv1.4.4

BENEFITS OF CHANGE:
Greater system stability.

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:
Same as NWPSv1.4.4

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:
Same as NWPSv1.4.4

RISKS:
Same as NWPSv1.4.4

PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION
At the first available opportunity.

BUGFIXES
Fix to a single file:
ush/shiproutes/plot_shiproutes.sh

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

I) Checking out the code from Github

Make the home directory for the model in $NWROOT:
> mkdir nwps
> cd nwps

Clone the NWPS code from the following Github repo, and check out the release tag:
> git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/nwps.git
> git checkout IT-nwps.v1.4.5-20220812

II) Building the executables

First define the path variable ${NWPSdir} in your profile file, which points to the base of the code checked out under (I) above.
> export NWPSdir=$(pwd)

Next, change directory to ${NWPSdir}/sorc/, and execute the general NWPS install script. This single step will install the total 
package, including all libraries and binary compilations:

> cd ${NWPSdir}/sorc
> ./make_NWPS.sh

Once the compilations are done, all executables are moved to ${NWPSdir}/exec, and the system will be ready.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS

Conduct on-demand runs for the 9 WFO domains listed above, namely AKQ, MFL, KEY, LIX, LOX, AJK, AER, ALU, and AFG. The files 
shiproute_plots_CG1_${PDY}${CYC}.tar.gz should be present. After unzipping this tarball, the graphics files it contains should 
display the correct date of each forecast hour (compare hour 0 with the analysis time listed in the Warn_Forecaster*.txt file). 
If possible, select WFO on-demand run submissions with initialization times unequal to the usual 3-hourly cadence of 00z, 03z, 
06z, 09z, ..., 18z, 21z.
