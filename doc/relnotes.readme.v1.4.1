IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

I) Checking out the code from VLab

Make the home directory for the model in $NWROOT:
> mkdir nwps
> cd nwps

Clone the NWPS code from the following Github repo, and checkout the release tag:
> git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/nwps.git
> git checkout IT-nwps.v1.4.1-20220428

II) Building the executables

First define the path variable ${NWPSdir} in your profile file, which points to the base of the code checked out under (I) above.
> export NWPSdir=$(pwd)

Next, change directory to ${NWPSdir}/sorc/, and execute the general NWPS install script. This single step will install the total package, including all libraries and binary compilations:

> cd ${NWPSdir}/sorc
> ./make_NWPS.sh

Once the compilations are done, all executables are moved to ${NWPSdir}/exec, and the system will be ready.


TEST INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run jnwps_estofs_prep from canned data for 2022/01/25

In jobs/JNWPS_OFS_PREP, point COMINestofs to the canned input data here:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/estofs/prod/estofs.20220125

Point COMINsicem1 and COMINsice to respectively:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/omb/prod/sice.20220124
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/omb/prod/sice.20220125

Set PDY=20220125, execute the job, and compare to results under:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/v1.4/ofs.20220125/estofs
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/prod/ofs.20220125/estofs

2. Run jnwps_rtofs_prep from canned data for 2022/01/25

In jobs/JNWPS_OFS_PREP, point COMINrtofs to the canned input data in this path:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/rtofs/prod/rtofs.20220125

Set PDY=20220125, execute the job, and compare to results under:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/v1.4/ofs.20220125/rtofs
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/prod/ofs.20220125/rtofs

3. Run jnwps_purge_prep from canned data for 2018/09/12

Since PSurge is run on demand, there was no recent input or output available on WCOSS1. However, MDL made canned input data from H FLorence (2018) available. This can be used to run jnwps_purge_prep, and verify against the COMOUT results obtained during testing. Note also that the PSurge results are blended onto the output water levels from jnwps_estofs_prep. This output has been obtained from WCOSS1, and is used here.

In jobs/JNWPS_OFS_PREP, point COMINpsurge to the canned input data in this path:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/psurge.v2.10/2018-Florence-Adv54-2.10.1/com/psurge/v2.10/psurge.20180912/

Copy the following WCOSS1 canned *output* data from jnwps_estofs_prep to the working directory $DATA:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/prod/ofs.20180912_test_psurge/estofs

Set PDY=20180912, execute jnwps_purge_prep, and compare to results under:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/v1.4/ofs.20180912_test_psurge/psurge

4. Test the NWPS on-demand runs (36 domains) for 2022/01/25

The NWPS on-demand runs use the following jnwps_ofs_prep output in $COMOUT prepared under 1 and 2 above:
ofs.20220125/estofs
ofs.20220125/rtofs

In addition, in jobs/JNWPS_PREP, point COMINgfs and COMINwave to this canned data:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/gfs/prod/gfs.20220125

Also, copy the following hotstart (restart) files to $NWGES:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/nwges/hotstart

Note that these hotstart files cannot be older than 3 days, otherwise NWPS will reject them. Therefore, before running the model, perform:

touch hotstart/???/??/20220125.??00*
touch hotstart/???/??/PE????/20220125.??00
touch hotstart/???/??/PE????/20220126.??00

Finally, in jobs/JNWPS_PREP, point dcom to the canned data here:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/dcom/prod/20220125/wgrbbul/nwps

Next, set PDY=20220125, and execute the suite of on-demand NWPS runs for all of its 36 domains. This will use the GFE forecaster wind fields from the canned dcom directory above. Note that NWPS will only run the newest of the input cycles available from each WFO, so expect the model to run only once for each of the 36 domains.

Compare the results of this test to the WCOSS2 test output here:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/v1.4/
sr.20220125
er.20220125
wr.20220125
ar.20220125
pr.20220125

Also compare against the WCOSS1 prod output below. Note that these directories contain the output for *all* of the cycles on 20220125. Compare the above results against the last cycle for each WFO only:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/prod/
sr.20220125
er.20220125
wr.20220125
ar.20220125
pr.20220125

5. Test the NWPS on-demand runs in GFS fail-over mode for 2022/01/25 (1 domain)

When there is an error in the GFE forecaster wind fields, NWPS is configured to fail over to GFS wind fields. This did not occur on 2022/01/25, but has been simulated by removing the GFE forcing file from the dcom tarball for WFO TBW. To execute this test, set dcom to:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/dcom/prod/20220125/wgrbbul/nwps_test_gfs

Now execute the on-demand run for the TBW domain as done in 4 above. Compare the output to the WCOSS2 test data here (no WCOSS1 prod output available for comparison):
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/v1.4/sr.20220125_test_gfs

Note that the output below should be displayed in the log file:
/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/nwps/com/nwps/v1.4/sr.20220125_test_gfs/tbw/18/Warn_Forecaster_TBW.20220125.txt
